## Hello, I'm Miguel :)

Here, I explore mathematical condensed matter theory and material science, and its intersection with open source computational software.

- I'll be continually updating this page as I keep better "official" documentation for my current project: machine learning assisted Nano-Topology Optimization (Nano-TO) for materials design at the atomic scale (learning as I go!)
